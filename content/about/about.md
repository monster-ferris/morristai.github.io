Hello and welcome to Morris Tai Blog! I am a Cloud Developer at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/), I try to write articles that are based on my work and observations, and I aim to present the information in a way that is easy to understand. The main focus of my articles is on topics like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Cloud (AWS/Azure), and Data Platforms ([Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), etc.).
